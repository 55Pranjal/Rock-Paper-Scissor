This interactive game allows users to play the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer. The game is implemented using JavaScript, along with basic HTML and CSS to create a simple yet engaging user interface.

This project is a fantastic way to practice JavaScript fundamentals like DOM manipulation, event listeners, and control structures. Plus, itâ€™s a fun game to share with others!
